.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a tester for the pipex project @42School.

This tester was made by a student. Therefore, you should not take it as it is in defence.

The tests create logs file in the \fBouts\fR folder. There are three types of file:

- `test-xx.txt`: this is the outfile of pipex.

- `test-xx-original.txt`: this is the outfile we would get with bash.

- `test-xx-tty.txt`: this is what your program writes (`stdout` and `stderr`)

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -c ", " --config
Allow you to reconfigure the tester.

.TP
.BR -t ", " --disable-timeout
Disable the timeout tests. May run the tests faster.

This option is \fBdeprecated\fR since the timeout tests are now runned in background, and don't last longer than the actual test.

.TP
.BR -u ", " --update
Force the tester to update (if needed only).

.SH EXIT STATUS
In case of success, the tester returns 0. If at least one test doesn't pass, it returns 1.
